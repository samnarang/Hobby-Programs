<p>1)Download the latest Git for Windows installer.<br>
2)When you've successfully started the installer, you should see the Git Setup wizard screen. Follow the Next and Finish       prompts to complete the installation. The default options are pretty sensible for most users.<br>
3)Open a Command Prompt (or Git Bash if during installation you elected not to use Git from the Windows Command Prompt).<br>
4)Run the following commands to configure your Git username and email using the following commands. These details will be associated with any commits that you create:<br></p>

<pre>$ git config --global user.name "Your UserName"<br>
 $ git config --global user.email "Your Email"</pre>

<a id="experience-with-github" class="anchor" href="#experience-with-github" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Experience with GitHub</h3>

<p>To complete the task, I had to sign up on GitHub, I went to the site and clicked on register, the process was pretty standard. I filled in the details and registered. Immediately after that the guide to using GitHub popped up, I read it and followed the steps to create my first repository. I uploaded the programs I had written in java and completed my task.</p>

<p>I faced a lot of difficulties when I was using Git. I didn't know any of the commands and so I had to search them on Google. I still am not quite used to using it but it is a pretty useful tool if you learn to use it properly.</p>
